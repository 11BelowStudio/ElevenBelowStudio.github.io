# \_11BelowStudio.github.io

Aka 'An attempt to perform [reverse domain name notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation)
but there's the slight problem of certian langauages like Java not permitting package names to start with a number
so I need to preface my packages with '\_11BelowStudio' instead'
